Answers to tasks 5 and 6

5. Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
  In test.properties file I created new parameter for real device.
  This parameter will be set in appium desired capabities.
  For real device I also added new capabity "appactivity"
  Implementation: src\main\setup\RealDeviceDriverSetup.java

6. Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests. Are there any difference with run on emulator?
   For native tests (for Contact MAnager application) full screen is visible when test open application on real device.
   But if test open the same application on emulator, part of the screen is not available as keyboard is visible.
   To run the same test on emulator I have to hide keyborad.
   driver().hideKeyboard();
